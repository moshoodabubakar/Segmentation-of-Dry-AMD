# Segmentation-of-Dry-AMD
Age-related macular Degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent cause of blindness globally, primarily affecting the Retina and resulting in central vision loss. Previous studies have proposed the use of Deep Learning and Image Processing-based systems to aid medical experts in the diagnosis and prognosis of AMD by identifying key features in OCT scans. This research focuses on the segmentation of retinal layer and AMD biomarker from these scans, utilizing novel image processing algorithms implemented in Yolo V8 and RoboFlow. The algorithms employed intensity thresholding, contextual information, polynomial curve fitting, and advanced denoising methods to achieve satisfactory results. 5 scan samples were collected from hospitals and 65 others where outsourced, and the segmentation system exhibited promising results. The system's performance varied across different regions; however, RPE segmentation was done which demonstrated an accuracy 84% 'Perfect' results.
